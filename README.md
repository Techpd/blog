Iâ€™m living the dream.

Iâ€™ve always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert, and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices. Today, Iâ€™m working from home as a Software developer for, Kilowott Inc., and I get to show off all these elements of who I am.

I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus. After a college education in Computer Application, and continuing to pursue that hobby, I realized software engineering was the right field for me.

Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on countless freelance projects and have been involved with a handful of notable startups. Today, Iâ€™m working as a Senior developer with the amazing team at Kilowott Inc., and am getting into Advance web development using React on my own time.

Iâ€™m familiar with a variety of markup language, style sheet , Frameworks, Libraries and programming languages, including HTML 5, CSS 3, JavaScript ,jQuery, React but Iâ€™m always adding new skills to my repertoire. Iâ€™m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
